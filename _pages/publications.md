[1] [Integrating Random Regret Minimization-Based Discrete Choice Models with Mixed Integer Linear Programming for Revenue Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03118), Published in Journal of Computer Science, Springer, IF:1.9 (Q1), June 2024.

**Abstract:** This paper explores the critical domain of Revenue Management (RM) within Operations Research (OR), focusing on intricate pricing dynamics. Utilizing Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) models, the study enhances revenue optimization by considering product prices as decision variables and emphasizing the interplay between demand and supply. Recent advancements in Discrete Choice Models (DCMs), particularly those rooted in Random Regret Minimization (RRM) theory, are investigated as potent alternatives to established Random Utility Maximization (RUM) based DCMs. Despite the widespread use of DCMs in RM, a significant gap exists between cutting-edge RRM-based models and their practical integration into RM strategies. The study addresses this gap by incorporating an advanced RRM-based DCM into MILP models, addressing pricing challenges in both capacitated and uncapacitated supply scenarios. The developed models demonstrate feasibility and offer diverse interpretations of consumer choice behavior, drawing inspiration from established RUM-based frameworks. This research contributes to bridging the existing gap in the application of advanced DCMs within practical RM implementations.

[2] [A Comprehensive Survey of Research Towards AI-enabled Unmanned Aerial Systems in Pre-, Active-, and Post-Wildfire Management](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1566253524001477), Published in Information Fusion Journal, Elsevier, IF:18.6 (Q1), August 2024.

**Abstract:** Wildfires have emerged as one of the most destructive natural disasters worldwide, causing catastrophic losses. These losses have underscored the urgent need to improve public knowledge and advance existing techniques in wildfire management. Recently, the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in wildfires, propelled by the integration of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and deep learning models, has created an unprecedented momentum to implement and develop more effective wildfire management. Although existing survey papers have explored learning-based approaches in wildfire, drone use in disaster management, and wildfire risk assessment, a comprehensive review emphasizing the application of AI-enabled UAV systems and investigating the role of learning-based methods throughout the overall workflow of multi-stage wildfire management, including pre-fire (e.g., vision-based vegetation fuel measurement), active-fire (e.g., fire growth modeling), and post-fire tasks (e.g., evacuation planning) is notably lacking. This survey synthesizes and integrates state-of-the-science reviews and research at the nexus of wildfire observations and modeling, AI, and UAVs â€” topics at the forefront of advances in wildfire management, elucidating the role of AI in performing monitoring and actuation tasks from pre-fire, through the active-fire stage, to post-fire management. To this aim, we provide an extensive analysis of the existing remote sensing systems with a particular focus on the UAV advancements, device specifications, and sensor technologies relevant to wildfire management. We also examine the pre-fire and post-fire management approaches, including fuel monitoring, prevention strategies, as well as evacuation planning, damage assessment, and operation strategies. Additionally, we review and summarize a wide range of computer vision techniques in active-fire management, with an emphasis on Machine Learning (ML), Reinforcement Learning (RL), and Deep Learning (DL) algorithms for wildfire classification, segmentation, detection, and monitoring tasks. Ultimately, we underscore the substantial advancement in wildfire modeling through the integration of cutting-edge AI techniques and UAV-based data, providing novel insights and enhanced predictive capabilities to understand dynamic wildfire behavior.

[3] [Age Estimation Based on Facial Images using Hybrid Features and Particle Swarm Optimization](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9721496), Published in 11th ICCKE IEEE Conference, Iran, February 2022.

**Abstract:** Face images provide significant biological information. Face age estimation is one of the primary research directions in face images. The appearance of the face changes dynamically, and these changes are influenced by a variety of factors such as light, aging, makeup, beard, etc. The human face has many characteristics, including emotions, sex, race, age, etc. Face age estimation has numerous applications in biometrics, security, commercial, military, interaction with computers, and providing services to the individual. In this paper, the age estimation system is divided into four distinct stages. The first step is to extract local features including Gabor wavelets (GW), Local Binary Pattern (LBP), Local Phase Quantization (LPQ), and Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG). These attributes are then combined in the second step as a feature fusion method, which combines four different feature extraction methods. In the following step, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) as a meta-heuristic optimization algorithm is used to decrease the size of attributes and find optimal features. Finally, we used classification and regression methods to estimate the age and age groups. Initially, we used support vector machines (SVMs) to determine the age class, and then used support vector regression (SVRs) to estimate the ages within those groups. Finally, our algorithm was examined on two widely used databases, i.e. the FG-NET and the MORPH, to determine its effectiveness regarding aging estimates. In the FGNET dataset, we achieved an MAE of 3.34 years and 75.69 percent classification accuracy, and in the MORPH dataset, we obtained an MAE of 3.21 years and 81.66 percent classification accuracy.
